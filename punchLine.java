/*
You are at a party and want some punch, so you walk over to the punch table and get in the punch line.

Naturally, every person in line wants to grab the cup with the most punch in it. The punch-fillers are pretty inconsistent, and fill each cup to varying percentages. You watch as the people in front of you pick out the fullest cups of punch, and you wonder how much punch you'll end up getting.

Initially, there are no cups of punch on the table.

Input will consist of N actions, each happening one after the other. There are two possible actions:

+ [a_i]: A cup of punch is filled up to a proportion of  and placed on the table.
-: The next person in line walks up to the table and takes the cup with the most punch. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one cup of punch on the table when the next person walks up.
After these  actions, it's your turn to grab a cup of punch. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one cup on the table at this time.

What is the maximum amount of punch you can end up getting?

Input Format

The first line contains N, the number of actions.

The next N lines will have one action each, as described the the problem statement.

Constraints



Output Format

Output a single number , the most punch that you can get at the end of the N actions.

This number should be accurate to the nearest .
